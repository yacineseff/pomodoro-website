Pomodoro Timer Website
Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer Website! This project is designed to help you stay focused and manage your time efficiently using the Pomodoro Technique.
Overview
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It involves working in focused intervals, typically 25 minutes, followed by a short break. This approach helps enhance productivity and prevent burnout by breaking work into manageable chunks.

Our Pomodoro Timer Website provides a user-friendly interface to:

Set and Start a Work Timer: By default, the work timer is set to 25 minutes, but you can customize it according to your needs.
Take Breaks: After each work interval, the timer will prompt a break period, encouraging you to rest and recharge.
Control Both Timers with One Button: A single button manages both the work and break timers, simplifying your experience.
Features
Customizable Work Timer: Set your preferred work interval from the input box.
Automated Break Timer: Automatically starts a break timer after the work interval ends.
Simple UI: Intuitive controls to start, pause, and reset both timers.
Getting Started
